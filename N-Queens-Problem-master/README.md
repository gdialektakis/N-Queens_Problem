# N-Queens-Problem

In order to execute the program you have to use Python3.6

Dependencies:
	* Numpy

Simply run runner.py without args for a small demo.


#Running the script
####By default simply running the runner.py will execute the 3 algos for the 8-Queen problem once (will print the board as well).
        python runner.py
        
####For a full input arg list type (check the beginning of runner.py for more):
        
        python runner.py -h
        
#### For some reason argparse doesn't parse booleans correctly so set suppress manually to False to avoid board prints.
